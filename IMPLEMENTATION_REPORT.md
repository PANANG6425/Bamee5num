# Order Management System - Implementation Report

**Project**: Restaurant Order Management System Enhancement  
**Date**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: Implementation Complete (Testing Pending)

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive order management system for a restaurant application. The system enables customers to place orders, managers to register employees with authentication credentials, and employees to manage orders through a dedicated dashboard with real-time notifications.

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ Order lifecycle management (Pending → In Progress → Finish)
- ✅ Employee authentication system with BCrypt security
- ✅ Real-time order notifications for employees
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Complete customer order tracking

## 1. Database Schema Updates

### Modified Tables

**`cart_items` Table**:
- Added `status` column (VARCHAR, default 'Pending')
- Valid statuses: 'Pending', 'In Progress', 'Cancelled', 'Finish'
- Created index on `status` for query performance

**`employees` Table**:
- Added `username` column (VARCHAR(50), UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
- Added `password` column (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL) for BCrypt hashes

---

## 2. Backend Architecture

### 2.1 Models Enhanced

**CartItem.java**:
- Added `status` field with validation annotations
- Default status: "Pending"
- Supports order lifecycle tracking

**Employee.java**:
- Added `username` field (unique constraint)
- Added `password` field for authentication
- Supports secure login system

### 2.2 Repositories Extended

**CartItemRepository**:
- `findByCustomerAndStatus()` - Filter orders by customer and status
- `findByStatus()` - Employee view of all orders by status
- `findAllByOrderByCreatedAtDesc()` - Chronological order listing

**EmployeeRepository** (Created):
- `findByUsername()` - Employee lookup for authentication
- `existsByUsername()` - Username uniqueness validation

### 2.3 DTOs Created

| DTO | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `OrderPlacementDto` | Customer order submission |
| `OrderResponseDto` | Order details with items, totals, status |
| `EmployeeLoginDto` | Employee authentication |
| `EmployeeRegistrationDto` | Manager registers new employees |
| `OrderStatusUpdateDto` | Update order status with validation |

All DTOs include Jakarta Bean Validation annotations.

### 2.4 Services Implemented

**OrderService** (New):
- Place order: Converts cart items to pending orders
- Get pending orders by customer
- Get all orders by status (employee view)
- Update order status with transition validation
- Order count by status (for notifications)
- Status transition rules: Pending → In Progress → Finish, or any → Cancelled

**EmployeeAuthService** (New):
- Login authentication with BCrypt password verification
- Session management for employee access

**ManagerService** (Updated):
- Employee registration with credential creation
- Order statistics for dashboard

**CartService**:
- Integrated with OrderService for seamless order placement

### 2.5 Controllers Created/Updated

**OrderController** (New):
- `POST /api/customers/{customerId}/place-order` - Place order
- `GET /api/customers/{customerId}/pending-orders` - View pending orders

**EmployeeController** (New):
- `POST /api/employees/login` - Authentication
- `GET /api/employees/orders` - View all orders (filterable by status)
- `GET /api/employees/orders/{orderId}` - Order details
- `PUT /api/employees/orders/{orderId}/status` - Update status
- `GET /api/employees/orders/pending/count` - Notification polling

**ManagerApiController** (Updated):
- `POST /api/managers/employees` - Register new employees
- Order statistics endpoint for dashboard

**PageController** (Updated):
- Added employee login page route

All endpoints configured with CORS and session management.

- `customer.js` - Changed "ชำระเงิน" (Pay) button to "สั่งจอง" (Place Order)
  - Calls place-order API
  - Shows success confirmation
  - Clears cart after successful order

**Features**:
- Order grouping by customer
- Item details display (name, quantity, price)
- Total calculation
- Color-coded status badges

### 3.2 Manager Features

**Updated Pages**:
- `manager.html` - Added employee registration form
- `manager.js` - Employee registration UI and validation

**Features**:

- Client-side validation
- Duplicate username checking
- Success/error message handling
- Order statistics display (pending, completed counts)

### 3.3 Employee Features

**New Pages**:
- `employee-login.html` - Login page with username/password
- `employee-auth.js` - Authentication handler with session management
- `employee-orders.html` - Order management dashboard
- `employee-orders.js` - Order management functionality

**Features**:
- Secure login with credentials
- Order management dashboard with:
  - Filter by status (Pending, In Progress, Finish, Cancelled)
  - Order details grouped by customer
  - Item lists with quantities and prices
  - Status update controls
  - Bill viewing modal
- Real-time notifications:
  - Polling every 30 seconds for new orders
  - Notification badge for pending orders
- Color-coded status system:

  - In Progress: Blue
  - Finish: Green
  - Cancelled: Red
- Role-based access control (cannot access manager pages)

---

## 4. Security & Access Control

### Authentication
- **BCrypt password hashing** for employee credentials
- Session-based authentication for customers and employees
- Secure login endpoints with validation

### Authorization
- Role-based access control implemented
- Employees cannot access manager endpoints
- Session validation on protected routes

### CORS Configuration
- Configured for `http://localhost:8080`
- Credentials allowed for session management
- Max age: 3600 seconds

## 5. Order Lifecycle

```
┌─────────┐
│ Pending │ ← Order placed by customer
└────┬────┘
     │
     ├─────────────┐
     ▼             ▼
┌────────────┐  ┌───────────┐
│In Progress │  │ Cancelled │
└─────┬──────┘  └───────────┘
      │              ▲
      ▼              │
   ┌────────┐        │
   │ Finish │◄───────┘
   └────────┘
```

**Status Transitions**:
- Pending → In Progress → Finish (normal flow)
- Any status → Cancelled (exception handling)
- Invalid transitions are rejected by backend validation

## 6. Key Technical Decisions

1. **No WebSocket Implementation**: Used simple polling (30-second intervals) for order notifications instead of WebSocket for simplicity.

2. **Cart Items as Orders**: Leveraged existing `cart_items` table with status field instead of creating separate orders table.

3. **Session Management**: Extended existing customer session pattern to employees.

4. **Status Validation**: Implemented business logic in service layer to enforce valid status transitions.

5. **Frontend Architecture**: Created separate pages for different user roles (customer-orders, employee-orders, manager) for clear separation of concerns.

## Conclusion

The system provides a complete workflow from order placement through fulfillment, with proper authentication, authorization, and real-time notifications. The architecture follows existing patterns in the codebase and uses proven technologies (Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Jakarta Validation, BCrypt).

**Implementation Time**: Tasks 1.0-9.0 completed  
**Remaining**: Testing and validation (Task 10.0)
